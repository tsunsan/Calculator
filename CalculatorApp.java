/**
 * This calculator implemented The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern. It is a software architecture pattern that separates an
 * application's data model, user interface, and control logic into three separate components, each with its own defined responsibilities:
 * <p>
 *
 *  Model: The model represents the application's data and business logic, and provides an interface for interacting with and manipulating that data.
 *  In an MVC application, the model is responsible for managing the data, performing any necessary calculations or transformations, and notifying the
 *  view and controller of any changes.
 * <p>
 *
 * View: The view represents the application's user interface, and is responsible for displaying the data and receiving user input.
 * In an MVC application, the view is responsible for rendering the data provided by the model, and sending any user input back
 * to the controller for processing.
 * <p>
 *
 * Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view, and is responsible for interpreting user input and manipulating
 * the model or view accordingly. In an MVC application, the controller is responsible for receiving user input from the view,
 * updating the model based on that input, and updating the view to reflect any changes in the model.
